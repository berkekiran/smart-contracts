# Smart Contract Library

This repository contains a collection of smart contracts written in Solidity by Berke Kiran, a programming language used for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, especially Ethereum. The contracts are categorized into three main directories:

## 1. Advanced Contracts

The `advanced-contracts` directory contains more complex smart contracts, further divided into several categories:

- **Airdrop**: The `Airdrop.sol` contract is used for airdropping tokens to a list of addresses.
- **Lock**: The `Lock.sol` contract is used for locking up tokens for a certain period of time.
- **Pool**: The contracts in this category (`PoolAdvanced.sol`, `PoolBasic.sol`, `PoolBasicRoles.sol`) are used for creating and managing liquidity pools.
- **Stake**: The contracts in this category (`StakeAdvanced.sol`, `StakeBasic.sol`, `StakeBasicRoles.sol`, `StakeRewardPool.sol`) are used for creating and managing staking pools.
- **Swap**: The contracts in this category (`SwapAdvanced.sol`, `SwapBasic.sol`, `SwapBasicRoles.sol`, `SwapPool.sol`) are used for creating and managing token swap functionality.

## 2. NFT Contracts

The `nft-contracts` directory contains smart contracts related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), further divided into two categories:

- **ERC1155**: The contracts in this category (`ERC1155Advanced.sol`, `ERC1155AdvancedRoles.sol`, `ERC1155AdvancedWhitelist.sol`, `ERC1155Basic.sol`, `ERC1155BasicReveal.sol`) are used for creating and managing ERC1155 NFTs.
- **ERC721**: The contracts in this category (`ERC721Advanced.sol`, `ERC721AdvancedRoles.sol`, `ERC721AdvancedWhitelist.sol`, `ERC721Basic.sol`, `ERC721BasicReveal.sol`) are used for creating and managing ERC721 NFTs.

## 3. Token Contracts

The `token-contracts` directory contains smart contracts related to tokens, specifically ERC20:

- **ERC20**: The contracts in this category (`ERC20Advanced.sol`, `ERC20Basic.sol`, `ERC20BasicRoles.sol`) are used for creating and managing ERC20 tokens.
